To build OpenCOR, you need the following tools:
 - Qt Creator (http://qt.nokia.com/): this is the cross-platform environment used to develop OpenCOR as a Qt application; and
 - CMake (http://www.cmake.org/): this is the cross-platform build system used to build OpenCOR (note: though Qt Creator comes with qmake, CMake is more widely used which is useful since OpenCOR relies on a few third party libraries. Also, CMake is perfectly supported by Qt Creator, so...).
 - Git (http://git-scm.com/): this is the distributed version control system on which OpenCOR relies. OpenCOR's Git repository can be accessed using either URL:
    - git://opencor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/opencor/opencor (read-only); and
    - ssh://<username>@opencor.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/opencor/opencor (read/write).
   Note: Git is supported by Qt Creator, but needs to be configured by selecting the Tools|Options... menu, then the Version Control section, and finally the Git tab. Alternatively, you can always use Git from the command line or, on Windows, TortoiseGit (http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/).

Once the above tools are installed and you have downloaded cloned a copy of OpenCOR, please follow the below instructions to build and run OpenCOR:
 - Start Qt Creator;
 - Open the CMakeLists.txt file which is located in the root directory of the OpenCOR project (by selecting the "File"|"Open File or Project..." menu or by pressing Ctrl+O);
 - Specify [OpenCOR]/build as the build directory;
 - Select MinGW as the generator;
 - Click on the "Run CMake" button;
 - Click on the "Finish" button;
 - Select "OpenCOR" as the run target (by selecting the "Build"|"Open Build/Run Target Seclector..." menu or by pressing Ctrl+T); and
 - Build and run OpenCOR (by selecting the "Build"|"Run" menu or by pressing Ctrl+R).
